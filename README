Sharkpool is a rolling smart contract miner
Bets are distributed over 100 blocks and aggregated between miners
Rewards are paid out on subsequent bets or by using the redeem function

The pool needs to be triggered externally by a vps script

npm compile
npm run mine

You may need to:
mkdir -p build/contracts/
cp -pr release/08-06-2017/* build/contracts/

There are also scripts/prepare_sharkpool3.sh and prepare_sharkpool4.sh
both copy local artifacts into build/contracts so they can be used by the
console miner and utilities.
